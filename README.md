# Description

This is a simple portfolio project created using the Vue.js framework. It utilizes Pinia as the state management solution and Vue Router for routing purposes.

The portfolio showcases various projects and provides detailed information about each project. It allows users to navigate through different project pages, view project descriptions, technologies used, and the year the projects were developed.

With Pinia as the state management library, the project effectively manages the application's state, ensuring efficient data handling and synchronization between components.

Vue Router enables smooth navigation within the portfolio, allowing users to access specific project pages directly via unique URLs. This ensures a seamless browsing experience and easy sharing of project links.
